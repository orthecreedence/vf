# ValueFlows

This crate is a set of (de)serializable structs based on the [ValueFlows schema][1],
along with various utilities for working with ValueFlows.

The goal of this library is to provide a serializable type layer for ValueFlows
such that it could be used in other libs/apps to create a VF system. This lib
does not deal with any kind of storage mechanism.
